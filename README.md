## Overview

![screenshot](./public/screenshot.png)

This is a typical frontend project in which someone lists all his personal tasks and tracks them in order to see their status, either those are completed or pending (or active as the challenge says). The following stories are fulfilled:
* You can add a new task.
* You can edit any task, aside of checking it as completed.
* In the general task list, you can delete any task.
* In the completed task list, you can delete one completed task or all completed task (a confirmation prompt appears to help you to decide the elimination of these tasks).
* If you want to add a task, you must put a title and some comments to explain about the new task.
* The task list is stored locally, so you can have a persistant list in your browser storage and see it in any site refresh.
* This app is a PWA.
* Improvement TODO: use a BaaS (Firebase, auth0, etc) to create an account to the app and replace the local storage with a more persistent storage (i.e. a database).
